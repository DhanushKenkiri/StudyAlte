# Requirements Document

## Introduction

StudyAlte is an AI-powered question paper generation platform that transforms educational content into comprehensive study materials. The platform leverages advanced AI technologies including Google Gemini and AWS Bedrock to automatically analyze uploaded documents, generate question papers, create interactive summaries, mind maps, and flashcards. This system is designed to help educators, students, and institutions streamline the assessment creation process while providing enhanced learning tools for effective exam preparation and knowledge retention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Content Processing and Analysis

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to upload educational documents (PDFs, Word files, images, text) and have the system automatically extract and analyze the content, so that I can quickly generate assessment materials without manual content review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads supported file formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, JPG, PNG, GIF) THEN the system SHALL extract text content using appropriate parsing libraries
2. WHEN content is extracted THEN the system SHALL process it using Google Gemini AI to identify key concepts, topics, and learning objectives
3. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL use Gemini's vision capabilities to analyze and extract text and conceptual information
4. WHEN content analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL categorize content by subject, difficulty level, and question types
5. IF file upload fails or format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and supported format guidelines

### Requirement 2: AI-Generated Question Papers

**User Story:** As an educator, I want the system to automatically generate comprehensive question papers from analyzed content, so that I can create assessments that match specific exam patterns and difficulty levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is processed THEN the system SHALL use AWS Bedrock agents to generate questions based on detected subject area (Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, General)
2. WHEN question generation is initiated THEN the system SHALL create papers with multiple question types (MCQ, short answer, long answer, numerical)
3. WHEN paper patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL match questions to specific exam formats and mark distributions
4. WHEN questions are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure appropriate difficulty distribution and topic coverage
5. WHEN generation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable question papers in structured JSON format
6. WHEN regeneration is requested THEN the system SHALL create alternative questions while maintaining pattern consistency

### Requirement 3: Interactive Study Materials Generation

**User Story:** As a student, I want the system to create interactive study materials from the same content used for question generation, so that I can prepare effectively using summaries, mind maps, and flashcards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is analyzed THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive study summaries with key topics and concepts
2. WHEN summaries are created THEN the system SHALL provide detailed explanations, importance ratings, and study time estimates
3. WHEN complex topics are identified THEN the system SHALL create interactive mind maps using Mermaid diagrams with tree-like structures
4. WHEN mind maps are generated THEN the system SHALL include navigation controls, zoom functionality, and topic relationships
5. WHEN flashcard generation is requested THEN the system SHALL create cards with questions, answers, difficulty levels, and topic categorization
6. WHEN study materials are complete THEN the system SHALL ensure consistency with the generated question papers

### Requirement 4: Session Management and History

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save my content analysis sessions and access previously generated materials, so that I can continue working on assessments and review past work efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate with Google THEN the system SHALL save their session data to Firebase Realtime Database
2. WHEN content is analyzed THEN the system SHALL create a unique session with timestamp and user identification
3. WHEN users access history THEN the system SHALL display saved sessions with titles, subjects, and creation dates
4. WHEN a historical session is selected THEN the system SHALL restore all previously generated content (summaries, question papers, mind maps, flashcards)
5. WHEN session data is loaded THEN the system SHALL allow users to regenerate or modify existing materials
6. WHEN users work across devices THEN the system SHALL synchronize session data in real-time

### Requirement 5: User Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to securely authenticate and manage my account, so that my generated content and session history remain private and accessible across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users want to access the platform THEN the system SHALL provide Google OAuth authentication
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create user profiles with display name and email
3. WHEN users are authenticated THEN the system SHALL allow access to personal history and saved sessions
4. WHEN users sign out THEN the system SHALL clear local session data while preserving cloud storage
5. WHEN unauthenticated users access the platform THEN the system SHALL provide limited functionality without history saving
6. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 6: Real-time Progress Tracking and Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time progress updates during content processing, so that I understand the system status and estimated completion times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content processing starts THEN the system SHALL display progress bars with stage indicators
2. WHEN processing stages change THEN the system SHALL update progress messages (analyzing files, generating content, finalizing)
3. WHEN processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide estimated time remaining
4. WHEN errors occur during processing THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and retry options
5. WHEN network issues are detected THEN the system SHALL display connection status and offline capabilities
6. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL provide success confirmations and next action suggestions

### Requirement 7: Responsive Design and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user accessing the platform from different devices, I want a consistent and intuitive interface that works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the platform on any device THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design with appropriate layouts
2. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL support touch gestures for navigation and interaction
3. WHEN screen size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt component layouts and font sizes appropriately
4. WHEN loading content THEN the system SHALL provide loading states and skeleton screens
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions
6. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL maintain accessibility standards for users with disabilities

### Requirement 8: Content Export and Sharing

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to export generated question papers and study materials in various formats, so that I can use them in different educational contexts and share with students.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN question papers are generated THEN the system SHALL provide JSON download functionality
2. WHEN summaries are created THEN the system SHALL allow export as formatted text files
3. WHEN mind maps are generated THEN the system SHALL provide export options for images and Mermaid code
4. WHEN flashcards are created THEN the system SHALL support export in standard flashcard formats
5. WHEN exporting content THEN the system SHALL maintain formatting and include metadata (generation date, source, AI model used)
6. WHEN sharing is requested THEN the system SHALL provide secure links for collaborative access (future enhancement)
