# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The YouTube Learning Platform is a web application that transforms passive YouTube video consumption into active, structured learning experiences. The platform leverages AI to automatically analyze video content and generate comprehensive learning materials including summaries, flashcards, quizzes, mind maps, and organized notes. This system is designed to help students, professionals, and lifelong learners maximize their educational outcomes from free YouTube content by converting it into course-like, interactive study sessions with progress tracking and content organization capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Video Content Processing

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to input a YouTube video URL and have the system automatically extract and process the video content, so that I can quickly access structured learning materials without manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid YouTube URL THEN the system SHALL extract the video transcript using YouTube's API or transcription services
2. WHEN the video transcript is extracted THEN the system SHALL process the content using NLP algorithms to identify key concepts, definitions, and learning objectives
3. IF the video has no available transcript THEN the system SHALL use speech-to-text conversion to generate one
4. WHEN content processing is complete THEN the system SHALL create a learning capsule containing all generated materials
5. IF the video URL is invalid or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and suggest troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 2: AI-Generated Learning Materials

**User Story:** As a student, I want the system to automatically generate comprehensive study materials from video content, so that I can engage with the material through multiple learning modalities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video content is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a concise summary highlighting key concepts and main points
2. WHEN key concepts are identified THEN the system SHALL create interactive flashcards for active recall practice
3. WHEN learning objectives are extracted THEN the system SHALL generate quiz questions with multiple choice and short answer formats
4. WHEN complex topics are detected THEN the system SHALL create mind maps showing concept relationships and hierarchies
5. WHEN the video contains structured information THEN the system SHALL organize it into searchable, categorized notes
6. WHEN all materials are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure consistency and accuracy across all learning components

### Requirement 3: Interactive Learning Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the generated learning materials through an intuitive interface, so that I can actively engage with the content and improve retention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing flashcards THEN the system SHALL provide spaced repetition functionality with difficulty tracking
2. WHEN taking quizzes THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and explanations for answers
3. WHEN viewing transcripts THEN the system SHALL provide clickable timestamps that jump to specific video segments
4. WHEN exploring mind maps THEN the system SHALL allow interactive navigation and concept expansion
5. WHEN reviewing notes THEN the system SHALL support highlighting, annotation, and personal note addition
6. WHEN using any interactive element THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design across desktop and mobile devices

### Requirement 4: AI Tutor Chat Interface

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to ask questions about the video content through a chat interface, so that I can get instant clarification and deeper insights about the material.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question about video content THEN the AI tutor SHALL provide contextually relevant answers based on the processed material
2. WHEN the AI tutor responds THEN it SHALL reference specific parts of the video or generated materials when applicable
3. WHEN a question is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions to provide better assistance
4. WHEN the AI cannot answer a question THEN it SHALL acknowledge limitations and suggest alternative resources
5. WHEN chat history exists THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context for follow-up questions

### Requirement 5: Content Organization and Search

**User Story:** As a user with multiple learning capsules, I want to organize and search through my content efficiently, so that I can easily revisit and build upon previous learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning capsules are created THEN the system SHALL automatically tag them with relevant topics and categories
2. WHEN users search for content THEN the system SHALL provide results across summaries, notes, flashcards, and quiz content
3. WHEN organizing content THEN the system SHALL allow custom tags, folders, and categorization
4. WHEN filtering content THEN the system SHALL support multiple filter criteria including date, topic, difficulty, and completion status
5. WHEN accessing organized content THEN the system SHALL maintain fast search performance even with large content libraries

### Requirement 6: Progress Tracking and Analytics

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to track my learning progress and performance across different topics and time periods, so that I can identify areas for improvement and maintain motivation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users complete learning activities THEN the system SHALL record progress data including time spent, accuracy rates, and completion status
2. WHEN viewing progress THEN the system SHALL display visual dashboards showing learning streaks, topic mastery, and performance trends
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL identify knowledge gaps and suggest review materials
4. WHEN tracking over time THEN the system SHALL provide insights on learning velocity and retention rates
5. WHEN setting goals THEN the system SHALL allow users to define learning objectives and track progress toward them

### Requirement 7: User Authentication and Data Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure access to my learning materials and the ability to manage my account and data, so that my learning progress is preserved and protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an account THEN the system SHALL require secure authentication with email verification
2. WHEN logging in THEN the system SHALL support secure session management with appropriate timeout policies
3. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information and comply with privacy regulations
4. WHEN users request data export THEN the system SHALL provide their learning materials in standard formats
5. WHEN users delete their account THEN the system SHALL securely remove all associated data while maintaining anonymized analytics

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to respond quickly and reliably regardless of the number of videos I process, so that my learning experience remains smooth and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing video content THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 2 minutes for videos up to 60 minutes long
2. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN it SHALL maintain response times under 3 seconds for interactive elements
3. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN it SHALL gracefully handle traffic spikes without service degradation
4. WHEN storing large amounts of content THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms
5. WHEN scaling infrastructure THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling to accommodate user growth
